Problem Statement
Title: Maximum Sum of Contiguous Subarray

Description:

Given an integer array arr, you need to find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray. A contiguous subarray is a part of the array that is composed of consecutive elements.

Write a function findMaxSumSubarray that computes the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray using Kadane's Algorithm. The function should be efficient in terms of both time and space.

Function Signature:

java
Copy code
public static int findMaxSumSubarray(int[] arr)
Input:

arr (array of integers): An array of integers where 1 <= arr.length <= 10^4 and -10^4 <= arr[i] <= 10^4.
Output:

An integer representing the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray.
Constraints:

The array can contain both positive and negative integers.
The array will have at least one element.
Example:

java
Copy code
public static void main(String[] args) {
    int[] arr = {1, -2, 3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4};
    System.out.println("Maximum Sum Subarray: " + findMaxSumSubarray(arr)); // Output: 6
}
Explanation:

In the example provided, the contiguous subarray with the maximum sum is [3, 4, -1, 2, 1], which sums up to 6. Therefore, the function should return 6.

This problem is commonly encountered in algorithmic challenges and is useful for understanding dynamic programming and optimization techniques.
