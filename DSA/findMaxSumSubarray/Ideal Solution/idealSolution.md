The ideal solution to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray is to use Kadane's Algorithm. This algorithm is efficient and straightforward, with a time complexity of 
𝑂
(
𝑛
)
O(n) and a space complexity of 
𝑂
(
1
)
O(1). Here's a detailed explanation of the solution along with the Java implementation:

Kadane's Algorithm
Algorithm Overview:

Initialization:

Start by initializing two variables:
currentMax to keep track of the maximum sum of the subarray ending at the current position.
globalMax to keep track of the maximum sum of any subarray found so far.
Iterate Through the Array:

For each element in the array:
Update currentMax as the maximum of the current element itself or the sum of currentMax and the current element. This step determines whether to include the current element in the existing subarray or start a new subarray.
Update globalMax to be the maximum of globalMax and currentMax.
Return Result:

After processing all elements, globalMax contains the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray.
