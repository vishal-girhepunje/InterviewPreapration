        // In the case of the HybridDevice interface, which combines features from both Smartphone and Tablet,
        // the implementing class HybridDeviceImpl needs to provide implementations for the methods declared in both Smartphone and Tablet interfaces,
        // resolving any potential ambiguity.


        //  Java interfaces provide a powerful mechanism for resolving the diamond problem and
        // facilitating multiple inheritance through composition. By implementing interfaces,
        // classes can inherit behavior from multiple sources without encountering the issues associated with 
        //traditional multiple inheritance. This promotes code flexibility, reusability, and maintainability.
