## What are the Object-Oriented Features supported by Java?

Java supports key Object-Oriented features like:
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Abstraction

## What are the different access specifiers used in Java?

Java uses access specifiers like:
- **Public**: Accessible from anywhere.
- **Protected**: Accessible within the same package and by subclasses.
- **Default (Package-Private)**: Accessible only within the same package.
- **Private**: Accessible only within the class.

## What is the difference between composition and inheritance?

- **Composition**: Combining different classes by creating objects within objects.
- **Inheritance**: Acquiring properties and behaviors of an existing class.

## What is the purpose of an abstract class?

An abstract class in Java serves as a blueprint for other classes. It allows the declaration of abstract methods, which must be implemented by its subclasses.

## What are the differences between constructor and method of a class in Java?

- A **constructor** is used to initialize the object of a class, while a **method** is used to perform a task.
- Constructors have the same name as the class, while methods can have any name.
- Constructors do not have a return type, while methods do.

## What is the diamond problem in Java and how is it solved?

The diamond problem occurs in multiple inheritance when a class inherits from two classes that have a common ancestor. In Java, this is solved by using interfaces, which support multiple inheritance.

## What is the difference between local and instance variables in Java?

- **Local variables**: Defined within a method and have a limited scope.
- **Instance variables**: Belong to the instance of the class and are declared within the class but outside any method.

## What is a Marker interface in Java?

A Marker interface in Java is an interface without any methods. It serves as a marker to the compiler, indicating that the implementing class has some special behavior.
